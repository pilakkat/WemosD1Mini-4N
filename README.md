## üìñ About the Project

This board is designed as a multi-purpose board which can help in using the standard Wemos D1 Mini board based on ESP8266 to a 4 relay smart control unit. 
The relays are miniature in size which can control upto 5A, 250AC (or 7A, based on which unit you used). It has 4 inputs which can be connected to AC switch and 4 outputs can be connected to loads. The board can be fitted behind the switchboard as an after market fit without rewiring, provided there is a neutral line available. 

Additional taping points are added for using the device in many other configurations. Due to limited inputs, there is also 2 digital switch support based on ADC divider circuit provisioned.

## üöÄ Usage
The design was done for using with Tasmota firmware, but user can use any firmware which can support the below configuraton.
- Inputs: D0, D1, D2, D3 and ADC (with voltage divider option for 2 digital pins)
- Outputs: D5, D5, D7 and D8

  Note: D3 has a pull-up and boot fails if pulled down during power on. 

D0 to D3 supports AC detection circuit. For using ADC divider based configuration, connect one switch between +3.3 and R21 (J6), second switch between R22 and ground (J7). All combinations of J6/J7 key presses and short circuits (SCB/SCG) are detectable via different ADC values if the default specified resistors are used. 

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration for Tasmota
Following configuration can be used for Tasmota firmware.

For AC detection circuit, you can also use following additional commands in tasmota console:
- switchdebounce0 109 : To set AC detection with 100ms debounce time
- switchmode0 1 : If you want to follow the manual switch instead of toggle every time
